        <p>In an ideal DSC experiment, the sample material is placed directly on the DSC sensor to obtain optimum heat transfer. However, that is not practical due to potential contamination of the sensor. Therefore, samples are placed in the samples pans for analysis.</p>
        <p>Selection of the appropriate DSC sample pan and lid is a very important step in the method development process. The results obtained from the  DSC can be affected by the sample pan. Proper method development is addressed in training courses available from TA Instruments. </p>
        <p>TA Instruments offers various types of DSC pans for use in your experiments. Use the following guidelines to select a sample pan material and configuration that meets the temperature and pressure range, composition, and reactivity requirements of your experiment.
</p>
        <h2><a name="Selectin"></a>Selecting a Sample Pan for the Tzero Press</h2>
        <p>There are two series of DSC pans available for use with the Tzero<sup>®</sup> Press. The Tzero Series sample pans and lids are manufactured using an advanced process to higher design specifications and their use typically results in improved resolution, sensitivity, and enthalpy and Cp repeatability compared to the Standard Series sample pans and lids. The Standard Series is suitable for general-purpose use and provide a balance between performance and cost. </p>
        <p>Within each series, the following pan types are currently available. Factors to consider when choosing a pan type are described briefly below.
</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Tzero Pan Types
</h3>
        <p>There are three types of Tzero pans available: the Tzero Pan (PN&#160;901683.901), Tzero Alodined Pan (PN&#160;901697.901), and the Tzero Low-Mass Pan (PN&#160;901670.901). 
</p>
        <p>There are also three types of lids available: the Tzero Lid (PN 901671.901), Tzero Hermetic Lid (PN&#160;901684.901), and Tzero Hermetic Alodined Lid (PN&#160;901698.901). 
</p>
        <p>These pans and lids are used to make three main pan types, which are described below:  Tzero Aluminum, Tzero Hermetic Aluminum, and Tzero Low-Mass Aluminum. </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="1">The Tzero Aluminum Pan is formed from the combination of the Tzero Pan and the Tzero Lid.  It is used for typical DSC applications where there is not a need for hermetic sealing.  This pan type has a capacity in volume of ca. 20 µL.  These pans are prepared using the black die set for the Tzero press.  Choose <span>Tzero Aluminum</span> as the pan type in TRIOS software when using this pan.
</li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="2">The Tzero Hermetic Aluminum Pan is formed from the combination of the Tzero Pan and the Tzero Hermetic Aluminum Lid.  This is a high-volume pan (ca. 40 µL) and is ideal when hermetic sealing is required, or when volatiles need to be contained.  (Note that care should be taken when using liquid samples, as the presence of liquid may compromise the cold-weld hermetic sealing mechanism).  This pan type is sealed using the blue die set for the Tzero press.  Choose <span>Tzero Aluminum Hermetic</span> as the pan type in TRIOS software when using this pan.  
</li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="3">For samples which may evolve large amounts of water (e.g., food), it is recommended to use the Tzero Hermetic Aluminum Alodined Pan. At higher temperatures and pressure, water can react with aluminum. This exothermic reaction may manifest in your measurement data. An inorganic alodine treatment applied to the Tzero aluminum hermetic pans eliminates the interference caused by the water in the sample. (Note that care should be taken when using liquid samples, as the presence of liquid may compromise the cold-weld hermetic sealing mechanism).This pan type is sealed using the blue die set for the Tzero press.  Choose <span>Tzero Alodined Aluminum Hermetic </span> as the pan type in TRIOS&#160;software when using this pan.  </li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="4">The Tzero Low-Mass Aluminum Pan is formed from the combination of the Tzero Low-Mass Pan and the Tzero lid.  This is a specialty pan type, which is ideal for high-sensitivity applications on small amounts of material (&lt;10 mg).  This pan type is sealed using the black die set for the Tzero press.  Choose <span>Tzero Aluminum</span> as the pan type in TRIOS software when using this pan. Note that Tzero Hermetic Lids should not be used with Tzero Low-Mass Pans.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The various pan type configurations are summarized in the following table:</p>

        <p>The Tzero Aluminum Pan is an excellent choice for the majority of applications where elimination of volatiles is not an issue. The performance of the Tzero pan is exceptional due to the precise flatness of the pan bottom and the contact of the lid to the upper surface of the sample.
</p>
        <p>The Tzero Pan and Tzero Lid packages are labeled with a black/blue stripe and a solid black stripe, respectively. The Tzero Press includes three dies (shown below) with a black ring that are easily recognized and are used with these pans and lids. The lower die is readily distinguished from the upper dies by a larger outer diameter compared to the upper dies. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../image/DSC/DSC_sample pans_2.png" />
        </p>
        <p> 
The design of the Tzero Lid and Tzero Press helps ensure that the pan bottom remains flat after sample loading. The lower die has a flat surface to support the pan bottom and minimize deformation from the sample when pressing the lid in place. You may choose either of two upper dies—one is flat and the other concave. The flat die is typically the first choice so that the sample-to-pan and sample-to-lid contact can be maximized. However, use of the concave die may be advantageous for irregularly shaped samples, as the lid will tend to conform to the sample better. 
</p>
        <p>When using the Tzero Aluminum Pan, the maximum volume is 20 µL. The maximum height of the sample should be 1.0 mm (0.039 in) or less in order for the lid to properly engage the pan. The average mass of the pan and lid is about 49.7 mg with a typical variability of 0.75%. Advanced Tzero technology available with the Discovery DSC  minimizes the impact of the higher mass, while the superior flatness of the pan bottom improves the sensitivity, resolution, and enthalpy and Cp repeatability of the heat flow measurement to levels never before achieved in routine practice.
</p>
        <p>The Tzero Pans and Lids are made of high purity aluminum and do not contain any intentional alloying elements. They are formed into their precisely designed shapes by an impact extrusion process that uses high pressure and a series of progressive dies to flow the aluminum into the precise shape of the tooling. Reliable adherence to stringent design specifications is achieved using this process. The Tzero Press and Pans represent the new state of the art in DSC sample preparation tools.

        </p>
        <p>The Tzero Hermetic Aluminum Pan is recommended for applications whenever volatiles generated by the sample during the experiment interfere with the transitions of interest. The Tzero Hermetic Aluminum Pan is not typically recommended for liquid samples, as the presence of liquid may compromise the cold-weld hermetic sealing mechanism.
</p>
        <p>The performance of the Tzero Hermetic Aluminum Pan is outstanding due to the precise flatness of the pan bottom and the design of the upper lid and sealing mechanism.
</p>
        <p>The Tzero Pan and Tzero Hermetic Lid packages are labeled with a black/blue stripe and a solid blue stripe, respectively.

            <img src="../image/DSC/DSC_sample pans_4.png" />
        </p>
        <p> 
The Tzero Hermetic Lid should be positioned with the concave side down. The lid is readily sealed to the Tzero Pan by a cold welding process that uses pressure applied by the upper die in the Tzero Press to join the two aluminum surfaces together. The sealing process does not exert any force on the bottom of the pan and the pan bottom remains flat. The pressure seal formed will typically hold 2-3 atmospheres of internal pressure. When pressurized above 2 atmospheres, the lid will deform outward, with the bottom of the Tzero Pan in contact with the DSC sensor remaining flat.
</p>
        <p>When using the Tzero Hermetic Aluminum Pan the maximum volume is 40 µL. The maximum height of the sample should be less than 1.9 mm (0.075 in) in order for the lid to properly position on the sealing surface of the pan. The average mass of the pan and lid is 51.5 mg with a typical variability of 0.75 %. Advanced Tzero technology available with the Discovery DSC  minimizes the impact of the higher mass, while the superior flatness of the pan bottom improves the sensitivity, resolution, and enthalpy and Cp repeatability of the heat flow measurement to levels never before achieved in routine practice.

        <p>The Tzero Low-Mass Aluminum Pan is intended for smaller sized samples that may benefit from the lower mass of the pan. The performance of the Tzero Low Mass pan is exceptional due to the precise flatness of the pan bottom and the contact of the lid to the upper surface of the sample.

        <h2><a name="Selectin2"></a>Standard Pans</h2>
        <p>The three types of pans within the Standard Series serve similar purposes. The main factor to consider when choosing one of these three pan types is whether the sample will evolve volatiles and/or water.
</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The Standard Aluminum pans (PN 900786.901) are the common first choice. These pans use lids (PN 900779.901) that are pressed down into contact with the sample and essentially encapsulate the sample in aluminum and thereby maximize the quality of the heat flow measurement. However, these types of lids are not sealed to prevent the loss of volatiles present in or generated by the sample during the experiment. Often, if these volatiles are allowed to evaporate, the endothermic heat flow associated with the vaporization obscures the transitions of interest. In some cases, the sample itself can flow out of these pans at higher temperatures and contaminate the cell. In the TRIOS software, select <span class="boolean">Aluminum</span> as the pan type when using this pan.</li>
            <li class="bullet" value="2">The Standard Aluminum Hermetic pans (PN 900793.901) have a different type of lid (PN 900794.901) and sealing mechanism that is able to hold the pressure buildup due to volatiles. This pressure can reach up to 2-3 atmospheres before the sealed pan releases the pressure. In many applications, the buildup and retention of the self-generated atmosphere by the sample improves the resolution of the transitions of interest.  In the TRIOS software, select <span class="boolean">Aluminum Hermetic</span> as the pan type when using this pan.</li>
            <li class="NoteIndent" value="3">NOTE: Care should be taken when using liquid samples, as the presence of liquid may compromise the cold-weld hermetic sealing mechanism.</li>
            <li class="bullet" value="4">The  Standard Aluminum Hermetic Alodined pans (pan PN&#160;900796.901 and lid PN 900790.901), are used when samples have high water content. At higher temperatures and pressure, water can react with the aluminum used to make these pans. This exothermic reaction can in some cases interfere with your measurement. An inorganic alodine treatment applied to the aluminum hermetic pans eliminates the interference caused by the water in the sample. In the TRIOS software, select <span class="boolean">Alodined Aluminum Hermetic</span> as the pan type when using this pan.</li>
            <li class="NoteIndent" value="5">NOTE: Care should be taken when using liquid samples, as the presence of liquid may compromise the cold-weld hermetic sealing mechanism.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Crimped and Hermetic Sample Pans
</h3>
        <p>In an ideal DSC experiment, the sample material would be placed directly on the DSC sensor to obtain optimum heat transfer. However, that is not practical due to potential contamination of the sensor. Therefore, samples are placed in sample pans for analysis. The table below shows the common types of crimped and hermetic sample pans and their recommended temperature ranges.
</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="NoteIndent" value="1">NOTE:  The useable temperature range could be reduced by the cooling accessory being used.</li>

        <h4>Crimped and Open Pans
</h4>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="1">Standard Series pans are designed to be run either open (no lid) or with a lid (crimped) on top of the sample. The lid is usually used to flatten the sample against the bottom of the pan for improved thermal contact. Without a lid, they provide the opportunity for good sample–atmosphere (purge gas) interaction.
These pans are available in aluminum, gold, copper, platinum, and graphite. (Note that the copper, platinum, and SFI pans have no lids.)
</li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="2">Aluminum pans are used for most experiments unless temperatures above 600°C are of interest for your sample or the sample reacts with aluminum.
</li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="3">Copper pans are widely used for oxidative stability experiments, particularly for polymeric materials used as wire and cable coatings.
</li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="4">Graphite pans are used for evaluating materials that might alloy with the various metal pans. Graphite pans should be used with a non-oxidizing purge gas (such as nitrogen).
</li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="5">SFI (Solid Fat Index) pans are designed specifically for evaluating edible fats and oils. They have a recessed rim around the bottom of the pan to prevent "wicking" due to surface tension.
</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Hermetic Pans
</h4>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="1">Hermetic pans are designed for evaluation of materials under self-generated atmosphere (modest pressure). Hermetic pans are almost always run sealed and are valuable for studies of volatile liquids (including vapor pressure studies), materials that sublime, and materials that generate corrosive or condensable gases. </li>
            <li class="NoteIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="2"> Care should be taken when using liquid samples, as the presence of liquid may compromise the cold-weld hermetic sealing mechanism.</li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="3">Aluminum hermetic pans (sealable to 2–3 atm. of internal pressure) are used for most samples. Alodined aluminum pans are used to evaluate samples that react with "untreated" aluminum (e.g.,, aqueous biological materials).       </li>
            <li class="NoteIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="4"> Care should be taken when using liquid samples, as the presence of liquid may compromise the cold-weld hermetic sealing mechanism.</li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="5">A modified lid, which contains a pinhole of specific known diameter (75 micron, PN 900860.901), is available for vapor pressure studies in the aluminum hermetic pans.
</li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="6">Gold hermetic pans are designed for evaluating materials under higher, self-generated pressures (up to 6 atm.) and temperatures (up to 725°C).
</li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="7">Standard Hermetic pans, however, do provide a poorer thermal contact between the sample, pan and disk. This fact, plus the added mass of the hermetic pans and covers, leads to a slight loss of resolution compared to the crimped pans.  The calorimetric accuracy is not affected, only the time constant of the system and the resolution of the measurement.

        <h3>Additional Information About the Specialty Pans
</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="1">High volume pans are stainless steel, disposable pans designed for evaluating liquid samples up to 75 µL. They are particularly useful for measuring weak transitions in aqueous-based biological and food samples. The pans can be sealed to withstand modest pressures so that these materials can be evaluated under self-generated atmospheres. Although the material of construction (stainless steel) will withstand exposure to temperatures above 250°C, it is not recommended that these pans be used above this temperature because rupture of the pan at that point could damage the DSC cell. 
</li>
            <li class="bullet" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="2">High pressure capsules are stainless steel capsules sealable to withstand up to 1450 psi internal pressure. They are specifically designed for pressure studies (evaluation of materials under self-generated atmospheres) and have a gold-plated copper rupture disk, which releases pressure gradually when it fails so that no DSC cell damage occurs. High pressure capsules can be reused; seals are for one time use only.</li>
            <li class="NoteIndent" value="3">NOTE:  The DSC Autosampler can be used with the high volume pans, but not with the high pressure pans. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Pan"></a>Pan Resistance Correction </h2>
        <p>The Discovery DSC  provides a more accurate measurement of true sample heat flow by accounting for heat flow within the DSC cell sensor as well as between the sensor and the sample pan. The resultant sample heat flow is designated as T4P heat flow.
</p>
        <p>The heat flow between the sensor and sample pan is primarily affected by the sample pan thermal resistance, which is primarily a function of the pan material (thermal conductivity) and temperature , assuming that both the pan and sensor are perfectly flat surfaces and in intimate contact. This assumption, however, is not true, even if careful experimental procedure is followed when preparing samples. Therefore, the thermal resistance of the thin layer of purge gas between the pan and sensor must also be considered.
</p>
        <p>TA Instruments has included in both TRIOS and the Q Series™ Thermal Advantage software fixed values for both pan and purge gas thermal resistances. Available pan choices include aluminum, hermetic aluminum, hermetic aluminum alodined, gold, hermetic gold, large volume, and "other". Purge gas choices include air, nitrogen, oxygen, helium, and outside purge.  When running experiments in Advanced Tzero mode T4P, select the pan type and purge gas that will be used. If you are using a pan type and/or purge gas that is not among the available choices listed, select "other."

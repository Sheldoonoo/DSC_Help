The Reversing Heat Flow is usually inverted to be consistent with the “endo down” notation.  This signal can be saved in the data file.
Reversing heat flow can be described as the heat capacity component of the total heat flow. Transitions seen in this signal are generally associated with changes in the heat capacity of a materials, and are usually thermodynamically reversible at the time and temperature at which they are detected. Typical transitions include the glass transition and some reversible melting.

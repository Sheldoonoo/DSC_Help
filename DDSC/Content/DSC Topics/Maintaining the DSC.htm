        <p>The primary maintenance procedures described in this section are the customer’s responsibility. Any further maintenance should be performed by a representative of TA Instruments or other qualified service personnel.

        <h2><a name="Cleaning"></a>Cleaning the User Interface</h2>
        <p>Clean the Discovery DSC user interface as often as desired. The user interface screen should be cleaned with a household liquid glass cleaner and soft cloth. Wet the cloth, not the screen with the glass cleaner, and then wipe off the screen and surrounding surfaces.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="WarningIndent" value="1">WARNING: Do not use harsh chemicals, abrasive cleansers, steel wool, or any rough materials to clean the user interface screen, as you may scratch the surface and degrade its properties.</li>

        <h2><a name="Cleaning2"></a>Cleaning a Contaminated DSC&#160;Cell</h2>
        <p>Baseline anomalies are often the sign of a contaminated cell. DSC cells must be cleaned properly to maintain satisfactory operation. Scraping the contamination off of the cell is not recommended.
</p>
        <p>If your baseline appears to show sample contamination, try the following recommended cleaning procedure. The procedure varies slightly depending upon the type of cooler that is installed. </p>

        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="1">Determine that the anomalies seen in the baseline are actually caused by contamination, and not a faulty Tzero™ calibration. Contamination is normally manifested in very sharp, distinct, and sometimes noisy peaks in an empty baseline (no pans) run. </li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="2">If you have determined that the anomalies in the baseline are in fact caused by contamination, select a solvent that is most appropriate for dissolving the contaminant. Note that in most cases an organic solvent such as acetone or methanol may be necessary, but an aqueous solvent might also work for some contaminates.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="3">Dampen the end of a small cotton swab with the chosen solvent. Avoid saturating the swab, simply moisten it.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="4">Gently dissolve the contaminants with the swab, starting at the outside of the silver housing within the sample chamber and working inwards. Repeat the process until the contaminants have been removed. Do not rub hard with the swab.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="5">Dry the interior of the cell with a clean dry swab. </li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="6">Heat the cell to 200˚C in nitrogen purge at approximately 50 mL/min, and hold for 5 minutes to remove all traces of solvent. 
</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="7">Verify by running an empty baseline test. If the anomalies are gone, but the baseline shape or slope is not acceptable, then Tzero calibration may be necessary. If the anomalies are still there, but are less evident, repeat the above steps and re-verify the baseline. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you are unable to remove the anomalies using the above procedure, then you will need to perform additional cell cleaning by heating the cell to a high temperature in an oxidizing atmosphere. </p>
        <ol>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="1">Begin by connecting the air purge. </li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="2">Proceed to the appropriate section below, according to the type of cooler installed.</li>
            <li class="NoteIndent" value="3">NOTE:  Cleaning of the cell is performed with the lid open to prevent the  gas exit tube from becoming plugged by condensing off-gases.  If your instrument is equipped with an Autolid mechanism,  open the cell manually at the start of the method.  You can open the cell by selecting <span class="boolean">Lid </span>on the DSC <a href="Introducing the Discovery DSC UI.htm">user interface</a> <a href="Introducing the Discovery DSC UI.htm"></a> or by clicking on the <span>Lids </span>icon within the Control panel.</li>

            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="1">Begin cleaning by heating the cell with an air purge to 50°C above the highest operating temperature or 600°C, whichever is lower, without pans. Use a heating rate of 20°C per minute. The Ramp test can be used for this method. Volatile contaminants can be removed at lower temperatures; organic contaminants must be oxidized above 550°C. 
</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="2">After cool-down, lightly brush out the cell with a small fiberglass brush (included in the DSC accessory kit).  Then remove the residue from the cell using clean compressed air.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="3">Run a baseline (empty cell). If there is an improvement relative to the baseline before “burn off” but the baseline is still unacceptable, repeat the procedure above.

        <ol>
            <li value="1">Begin cleaning by heating the cell with an air purge to 50°C above the highest operating temperature (400°C maximum for the RCS 40) or 550°C, whichever is lower, without pans with the cooling accessory ON. Use a heating rate of 20°C per minute. The Ramp test can be used for this method. Volatile contaminants can be removed at lower temperatures; decomposed contaminants must be oxidized above 550°C.</li>
            <li class="WarningIndent" value="2">WARNING:  Do not exceed 100°C with the RCS cooling head installed and the RCS power off.  Serious damage and/or injury could occur.
</li>
            <li class="CautionIndent" value="3">CAUTION:  We recommend that you do not use the RCS when running isothermal experiments above 400°C.  Damage to the unit can occur if used at high temperatures for extended periods. The RCS 40 cannot be heated above 400°C.
</li>
            <li value="2" style="margin-top: 8px;">After cool-down, lightly brush out the cell with a small fiberglass brush (included in the DSC accessory kit).  Then remove the residue from the cell using clean compressed air.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="3">Run a baseline (empty cell).  If there is an improvement relative to the baseline before “burn off” but the baseline is still unacceptable, repeat the procedure above.  If you need to hold longer at the higher temperature to remove the contamination, you will need to remove the RCS <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.DSC">or LNCS</MadCap:conditionalText> heat exchanger before conducting this experiment.  You will also need to temporarily change the selected cooler type to FACS on the <span>Options </span>&gt; <span>Discovery DSC</span> &gt; <span>Cooler </span>panel in TRIOS&#160;software.  Be sure to reselect the correct cooler type after performing this experiment.
</li>
            <li class="NoteIndent" value="4">NOTE:  When removing the RCS<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.DSC">/LNP</MadCap:conditionalText> heat exchanger from the cell, it is recommended that the RCS <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.DSC">or LNP</MadCap:conditionalText> be allowed to warm to room temperature after turning it "off" before removing the heat exchanger.  That will minimize the chance for moisture condensation/contamination and will avoid the possibility of damaging the connector hose by moving while cold and brittle.
</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="4" style="margin-top: 8px;">Removing the heat exchanger requires that the DSC-RCS<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.DSC">/LNCS</MadCap:conditionalText> system be calibrated after reassembled on the cell.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="5">Minor baseline anomalies due to sample contamination that remain after cleaning may be compensated for by a new Tzero calibration. They cannot be compensated for by a T1 baseline calibration.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="6">If the baseline problem remains, it is probably not due to contamination; the cell may need to be replaced (contact your TA Instruments service representative).
</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" style="margin-top: 8px;" value="7">Once the baseline is acceptable, return to normal operation.

        <h1>Setting Up a DSC Standard Ramp Procedure</h1>
        <p>DSC ramp experiments heat or cool the material at a constant rate.  The results obtained are affected by the previous thermal history (often imparted on the material during processing [e.g., extrusion]).  Therefore, the results are designated "as received."</p>
        <h2><a name="Test"></a>Test Setup</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Mercury DSC">To select this test, click <span class="boolean">Experiments</span> &gt; <span class="boolean">Design View</span> in the File Manager. In the <span class="boolean">Procedure</span> window, select <span class="boolean">Ramp</span> from the <span class="boolean">Test</span> drop-down list (shown below).</p>

        </p>
        <p>Choose the following parameters after selecting the Standard&#160;Ramp procedure:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1"><span>Start </span>and <span>Final temperature</span>:  The actual start and final temperatures chosen for a specific experiment must be within the usable temperature range of the DSC cell/cooling accessory combination that you are using. These temperatures should bracket the region where sample transitions are expected to occur and they should be far enough below or above the transitions to establish a stable baseline. Be sure to stay below the decomposition temperature of the sample. (Note that the decomposition temperature depends on the heating rate).</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li class="SubBulletIndent" value="1"><span>Use current</span>:&#160;Check this box to use the temperature of the DSC cell at the current moment (usually ambient temperature, 30 to 35°C). In this case, the ramped heating begins immediately on starting the experiment.
</li>
            <li class="SubBulletIndent" value="2">Unselect <span>Use current</span> to choose the specific temperature desired. In this case, the system equilibrates at the chosen temperature before ramped heating begins.
</li>
            <li class="SubBulletIndent" value="3">The full temperature range of analysis for the DSC cell is –180 to 725°C, but may be attenuated depending on the type of sample pan, lid type, and cooling accessory used. (Only inert gases such as nitrogen can be used above 600°C.) To evaluate materials below room temperature or to run controlled-cooling experiments, the DSC cell requires an active cooling source. Typically, this is provided bya refrigerated cooling accessory, RCS (usable from –120 to 550°C). In addition, there are multiple types of DSC pans available. All of them are acceptable for use to 725°C except for aluminum pans, which should only be used to 600°C.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="2"><span>Heating (Ramp) rate</span>:  The acceptable range of heating/cooling rates for conventional DSC is 0.01 to 200°C/minute.  This range depends on a number of variables including the temperature range covered and the type of cooling accessory.  Faster heating/cooling rates generally increase sensitivity, particularly for thermal events such as the glass transition.  They also obviously shorten the time of analysis.  Slower heating/cooling rates generally provide better resolution (separation of closely spaced thermal events).  Heating rates of 10 to 20°C/minute and cooling rates of 5 to 10°C/minute are a good starting point for most materials.</li>

        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="1"><span>Load Window</span> (applicable for Autosampler instruments only): This parameter is used to specify temperature range used to load the sample for the specified run.  The experiment will not start until this condition is met.
Select between the following options:
</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li class="SubBulletIndent" value="1">Check the <span>Use Standby Temperature</span> option to use the standby temperature (as defined on the <span>General </span>Control panel).</li>
            <li class="SubBulletIndent" value="2">Uncheck this option to define a specific temperature range for load.
</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="2"><span>End of Test</span> options:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li class="SubBulletIndent" value="1">	For DSC Autosamplers:  Check <span>Discard pan in waste bin at end of test</span> to have the Autosampler arm place the pan in the waste bin at the end of the run. If this is not selected, the arm will return the pan to its previous position on the sample tray at the end of the run.
</li>
            <li class="SubBulletIndent" value="2"><span>Use Standby Temperature</span>: This parameter is used to specify the temperature used to unload the sample for the specified run. </li>
            <li class="SubBulletIndent2" value="3">Check this option to use the standby temperature (as defined on the <span>General </span>Control panel). </li>
            <li class="SubBulletIndent2" value="4">Uncheck this option to define a specific temperature range for unload.


If desired, enter the delay time that the instrument will delay after reaching the unload temperature range before unloading the sample. A delay time of 2 minutes should be used when an experiment ends with the cell at subambient temperature. This allows time for the cell lids and cover to warm in order to prevent moisture from condensing on cold components.</li>

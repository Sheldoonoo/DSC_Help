        <p>Each Discovery experiment,&#160;or "run," consists of a set of user-defined <span>Sample </span>and <span>Procedure </span>experimental parameters. The <span>Sample </span>parameters vary based on the instrument type, but include info such as sample name, pan type, etc.<span> <![CDATA[ ]]></span>The <span>Procedure </span>parameters include the mode, the custom method or predefined template, and other experimental information.  For instructions on defining these parameters, refer to the Defining Experimental Parameters Help topic applicable to your instrument.</p>
        <p>Often, more than one run is performed in thermal analysis, especially when an&#160;Autosampler is present on the instrument. This collection of multiple runs is known as a "run sequence". Individual runs and run sequences are created in either the <span>Design View</span> or <span>Running Queue</span> (see the <a href="#Sequence" class="selected">Sequence View Types</a> section below for information). Both of these views contain the same basic tools for creating, modifying, and saving runs. However, runs are only executed from the Running Queue.  Once an experiment completes, the experimental data is copied to the user's designated directory and the experimental information is recorded in the instrument  <a href="../DSC 25 250 2500 Topics/DSC2 History View.htm" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Mercury DSC">History View</a>.    If any experiment faults due to an error at the start of the test, the run is moved to the <span>Incomplete </span>container.</p>

        <h3><a name="Single"></a>Single Run Form vs. Table View</h3>
        <p>To view and configure runs, access the "Single Run" form located in the <span>Design Run</span> view shown above or <span>Queued Run</span> view, depending on the selected run in the File Manager <span>Experiment </span>list. Alternatively, access the "Table View" in the <span>Design View</span> experimental window shown below or the <span>Running Queue</span> window. Both of these views display a limited number of experimental parameters.<br /></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="1">The Single Run form provides complete access to all the experimental parameters associated with the run and is used to create a full Procedure. See <a href="Creating Sequences.htm">Creating Run Sequences</a> for more information.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="1">The Table View provides a summary of all the runs in a sequence, allowing for a quick review of key parameters and for copying of run information from one experiment to another. In this view, the experimental information can be arranged in a spreadsheet-style table view, with each row representing a single run. Columns containing the specific experimental information are customizable. See  <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Mercury DSC"><a href="../DSC 25 250 2500 Topics/Using Table View.htm">Using Table View</a> <![CDATA[ ]]></MadCap:conditionalText>for more information.</li>

        <h2><a name="Sequence"></a>Sequence View Types</h2>
        <p>The following sections describe the different ways to access the sequence views. These sequence views are selectable from the File Manager <span>Experiment </span>panel.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3><a name="Design"></a>Design View</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../image/Other/Thermal Design View.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The <span>Design View</span> contains the tools needed to create sequences of runs. The Design View tools are available both online (when connected to an instrument, performing a run, etc.) and offline (without any connection to the instrument needed). Each individual Design View can contain a series of runs (a sequence) defined by the user. The user can create as many different Design Views sequences as desired.	
</p>
        <p>The Design View sequences are not executed directly from the Design&#160;View window. Once a series of runs is arranged into a sequence, copy the sequence over to the Running Queue for execution (from within the File Manager <span>Experiment </span>view, drag the runs from the Design View to the Running Queue), or save as a <span>Sequence file</span> for future recall. Or, since <a href="Creating Sequences.htm#Working">multiple Design Views</a> can be open at the same time, your sequence can simply remain in the Design View until you are ready to use or edit it.  Note that sequences in the Design&#160;View are never deleted unless manually done so by the user.
</p>
        <p><a href="#top" class="BacktoTop selected">Back to top</a>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3><a name="Running"></a>Running Queue</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../image/Other/Thermal Running Queue bar.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The <span>Running Queue</span> is the programmed queue of experiments that are run when the <span>Start </span>button is clicked. The Running Queue is the only sequence view from which you can actually execute experiments. The run at the top of the queue is always the next run to be executed. When the run completes, it is deleted from the queue, a data file for that run is created, and an entry containing all the run information is created in the <a href="../DSC 25 250 2500 Topics/DSC2 History View.htm" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Mercury DSC">History View</a>. Each run then moves up in the queue and the next run is executed, and so on. This process continues until the Running Queue is depleted.
</p>
        <p>Experiments can be set up in the Running Queue with all the same functionality as a Design View, but it is important to keep in mind that when the sequence completes, the queue is empty (as all runs in the sequence are deleted upon execution). To avoid the accidental deletion of a sequence, it is recommended that
sequences be created in the Design View and then exported to the Running Queue for execution. Note that sequences in the Design&#160;View are never deleted unless manually done so by the user.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3><a name="Incomple"></a>Incomplete </h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../image/Other/Thermal Incomplete.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The <span>Incomplete </span>view collects unfinished runs; a run may fail to complete, for example, as a result of the purge gas running out or some other external issue.  In this case, the suspect run moves from the Running Queue into the Incomplete view, and the rest of the run sequence continues.  The operator can then perform the desired action for these Incomplete runs (either delete the run or send it back to the Running Queue). </p>
        <h2><a name="Switchin"></a>Switching Sequence Views
</h2>
        <p>Switch between the various sequence view types by performing either of the two options described below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Using the File Manager  <span>Experiments </span>panel: Select the arrow <img src="../image/Other/Thermal File Manager Sequence Views arrow.png" class="imgInline" /> to display the run list for the selected view. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../image/Other/Thermal File Manager Sequence Views.png" class="imgIndent" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">By selecting the experimental window tab: Select the desired document by clicking on the appropriate tab in the experiment window.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../image/Other/Thermal Creating Seq Overview.png" class="imgIndent" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The image below shows  the various sequence view types and experimental windows as they appear in TRIOS&#160;software. The experimental parameters that appear in the experiment window depend upon the run selected in the File Manager  <span>Experiments </span>panel on the left. Therefore, using the image below as an example, clicking <span>Run 1</span> or <span>Run 2</span> within the <span>Design View</span> in the File Manager displays the parameters for that respective run in the experimental window. The parameters for each individual run can then be reviewed or edited in Single Run form (<span>Design Run</span> experiment window, shown below) or Table View (<span>Design&#160;View</span> experimental window). However, clicking the <span>Running Queue</span> tab from the experiment window enables the <span>Running Queue</span> sequence view as the active sequence view in the File Manager  and also the Single Run form (Queued Run) associated with the selected run in the Running Queue list.  

At the top of the Single Run form is text showing the associated run.</p>
